# Python

Here I'll keep all the documentation about Python that can be useful for me and others. 

## So, what's next?

Wanna learn Python? Cool! Keep in mind that Python3 is the future while Python2 is [dying officially](https://pythonclock.org/) in 2 years. 

In case you don't know there are several paths you can follow in the python world.

Some of them are:

- Web Full Stack 
- Desktop and Mobile 
- Data Science 
- Automation 
- IoT 

## Basics

- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/): very popular and easy guide to Python.
- [Python by MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Drafts/Python): a tutorial that is being written rn by MDN, most parts are done already.
- [TutorialsPoint's Python](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3/): that covers some advanced topics like GUI programming, Database access and so on.
- [Regular Expressions PyCon 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abrcJ9MpF60) it seems a little bit confusing at first but believe me, the job it is doing for you is a lot more complex! (common interview question too!) you can test your patterns using [regex101](https://regex101.com/).

## Practice

- It's a good idea to do some exercises after learning the basics. [Practice Python](http://www.practicepython.org/) has some challenging ones with solutions.
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is where developers achieve code mastery through a challenge.

## Full Stack

In case you want to learn web development, you got Django!, it's high-level web framework for fast development, it's as easy and secure as any framework can be, some good tutorial for learning Django:

- [Django by MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django). MDN got a very nice tutorial to start learning Django.
- Official [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/) is a good start too.
- Small [Open-Source Django Projects](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/2015/11/23/small-open-source-django-projects-to-get-started.html) you always learn from others' projects.
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) Courses with 100% discount:

  django-core - Django in depth! coupon: "CFENOV2016".

## Data Science

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads) a Python distribution with all you need for data science.
- [Youtube playlists](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex/playlists) about graphics and basics on machine learning.
- [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions), practice the theory you've learned in real-world scenarios.

## Keeping you updated

- [PyVideo](http://pyvideo.org/) contains Python Conferences about almost everything.
- [Python Weekly](https://www.pythonweekly.com/) A weekly newsletter featuring curated news, articles, new releases, jobs etc related to Python.
- [Github](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language:Python+license:gpl&type=Repositories&ref=advsearch&l=Python&l=) search, find and collaborate on GPL Projects written in python.
